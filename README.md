- SCAM -> Single component angular modules for better tree shaking (Ng 14 supports standalone components, and soon I will convert the whole app)
- UI libs -> UI libs can only contain a UI component which should recieve the data only via @Input(), and emit events/data via @Output(). These components can only inject services regarding the view, E.g. MaterialDialog service 
- Feature libs -> Can be routed to, can access data from any source 
- DataAccess libs -> Handles data stuff and couple of other things which are connected with the data layer (ngrx, api cals etc.)
- Shell libs -> Entry point for some domain. Shell should always have feature in which we store routes, and layout which should be the layout for the current domain. Layout can access any data and should be in layout folder under shell lib.
- ViewModel -> Ngrx Store is used as a global store while ngrx/@component-store is used as a [viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel). Viewmodel should grab the data from the global store (or some other source) and prepare it for the view injection via async pipe, also, majority of the business logic is located in the viewmodels which helps to keep our components clean and extremely easy to test and maintain.

- Util libs -> Util libs can only contain a util stuff. Util libs can import only from shared & other util libs
- Feature libs -> Place to store controllers 
- DataAccess libs -> Stores services related to data layer, repositories, dtos and couple of other related things
- Shell libs -> Entry point for some domain. Shell libs import controllers & other shell libs. 
- Core -> Stuff that is app specific (confgs etc.). ATM it stores db config, passport config & environment configs
